Call the code by calling 
python NN.py x y z train.csv test.csv

x is the depth value, y is the breadth value, and z is the number of training cycles.
You can replace the csv files with different files. I chose to use the sigmoid activation
function for all layers of the NN, so my accuracy usually rounds out to be 56.69% with my smaller
data set and 50.74% with the larger set.
If no output had been printed, the program is likely running slower due to the large file
size or the large number of training cycles.
